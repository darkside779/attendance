Great — you’re describing a facial-recognition-based attendance system with two user roles (Admin and Accounting). Let’s outline the system architecture, features, and UI flow so we can move toward development.

🧠 System Overview
🎯 Goal:

Build an attendance management system with facial recognition to track employee working hours, manage shifts, and calculate salaries.
There will be two user roles:

Admin

Accounting

👥 User Roles and Permissions
1. Admin

Full system access

Can manage:

All users (Admins + Accounting users)

Employee data

Shifts and schedules

Salary configurations (rate/hour, bonuses, deductions)

Reports generation (daily, weekly, monthly attendance and payroll)

Can view logs and export data (Excel/PDF)

2. Accounting

Restricted to:

Registering employees with ID, Name, Phone, and Face

Assigning shifts to employees

Viewing attendance records

Calculating salaries based on working hours

Cannot delete system data or access admin settings

🧩 Core Features
